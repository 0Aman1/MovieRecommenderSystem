## Features

- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit
- Movie recommendations based on content similarity
- Real-time movie poster fetching from TMDB API
- Top 5 movie recommendations display
- User-friendly dropdown selection of movies

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.13
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Requests (for API calls)
- Pickle (for model storage)

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                  # Main application file
â”œâ”€â”€ movie_dict.pkl         # Preprocessed movie data
â”œâ”€â”€ similarity.pkl         # Pre-computed similarity matrix
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ archive/              # Raw data folder
    â”œâ”€â”€ tmdb_5000_credits.csv
    â””â”€â”€ tmdb_5000_movies.csv
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and go to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Select a movie from the dropdown menu

4. Click the "Recommend" button to get similar movie recommendations

## How It Works

1. **Data Processing**: 
   - The system uses TMDB movie dataset with 5000 movies
   - Movie features are extracted from various attributes like genres, keywords, cast, crew, etc.
   - This processed data is stored in `movie_dict.pkl`

2. **Similarity Computation**:
   - A similarity matrix is computed based on the movie features
   - The matrix is pre-computed and stored in `similarity.pkl`
   - This enables quick retrieval of similar movies

3. **Movie Recommendation**:
   - When a movie is selected, the system finds the most similar movies using the pre-computed similarity matrix
   - Top 5 most similar movies are recommended
   - Movie posters are fetched in real-time from TMDB API

## Dependencies

Key dependencies include:
- streamlit==1.49.0
- pandas==2.3.2
- numpy==2.3.2
- requests==2.32.5

For a complete list of dependencies, see `requirements.txt`

## API Integration

The system uses TMDB API to fetch movie posters. The API endpoint used is:
```
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}
```

## Future Improvements

- Add movie descriptions and ratings
- Implement collaborative filtering
- Add movie trailers
- Include user ratings and reviews
- Add genre-based filtering
- Implement advanced search functionality
